# Modern Secure Form

This project is a modern and secure form application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. It uses **React Hook Form** for efficient form handling, **Zod** for schema-based validation, and **React Hook Form Resolver** to seamlessly integrate the two.  

The form is designed with best practices in validation, security, and scalability, offering a clean and robust user experience.

## Features

- **Efficient Form Handling**: Built with React Hook Form for high performance.
- **Schema-based Validation**: Uses Zod for strong and type-safe validation.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety and developer-friendly coding.
- **Vite for Development**: Lightning-fast development environment.

## What I Learned

- Creating scalable forms with React Hook Form.
- Implementing schema-based validation with Zod.
- Combining form resolvers for seamless validation integration.
- Using Vite to optimize development and build processes.
